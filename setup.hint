ldesc: "Sirius is a program for playing the game of othello. The program
includes an AI (Artificial Intelligence) opponent which plays at a very
challenging level and is actually quite hard to beat. The AI opponent's
strength can therefore be adjusted in several ways to give you a
suitable opponent."
